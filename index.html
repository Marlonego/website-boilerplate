                Let me make one thing clear first. If you are a beginner programmer, this article is not meant to make
                you
                feel
                bad about the mistakes that you might be making but rather to make you aware of them, teach you to spot
                signs of
                them, and remind you to avoid them.
            </p>

            <p>I have made these mistakes in the past and learned from each and every one of them. I am happy to have
                formed
                coding habits to help me avoid them. You should do too.</p>
            <p>These mistakes are not presented here in any particular order.</p>

            <h2>1) Writing Code Without Planning</h2>

            <p>
                High-quality written content, in general, cannot be created easily. It requires careful thinking and
                research.
                High-quality programs are no exception.
                Writing quality programs is a process with a flow:
                Think. Research. Plan. Write. Validate. Modify.
                Unfortunately, there is no good acronym for this. You need to create a habit to always go through the
                right
                amount of these activities. </p>
            <p>

                One of the biggest mistakes I have made as a beginner programmer was to start writing code right away
                without
                much thinking and researching. While this might work for a small stand-alone application, it has a big,
                negative
                effect on larger applications.
            </p>
            <p>
                Just like you need to think before saying anything you might regret, you need to think before you code
                anything
                you might regret. Coding is also a way to communicate your thoughts.

        <p>Here is my version of that quote:</p>
        <blockquote>
            <p class="big">
                When reviewing code, count to 10 before you refactor a line. If the code does not have tests, a hundred.

        <p>Programming is mostly about reading previous code, researching what is needed and how it fits within the
            current system, and planning the writing of features with small, testable increments. The actual writing of
            lines of code is probably only 10% of the whole process.</p>

        <p>Do not think about programming as writing lines of code. Programming is a logic-based creativity that
            needs nurturing.</p>

        <h2>2) Planning Too Much Before Writing Code</h2>

        <p>Yes. Planning before jumping into writing code is a good thing, but even good things can hurt you when you do
            too much of them. Too much water might poison you.</p>

        <p>Do not look for a perfect plan. That does not exist in the world of programming. Look for a good-enough
            plan, something that you can use to get started. The truth is, your plan will change, but what it was
            good for is to force you into some structure that leads to more clarity in your code. Too much planning
            is simply a waste of your time.</p>

        <p>I am only talking about planning small features. Planning all the features at once should simply be
            outlawed! It is what we call the Waterfall Approach, which is a system linear plan with distinct steps
            that are to be finished one by one. You can imagine how much planning that approach needs. This is not
            the kind of planning I am talking about here. The waterfall approach does not work for most software
            projects. Anything complicated can only be implemented with agile adaptations to reality.</p>

        <p>Writing programs has to be a responsive activity. You will add features you would never have thought of
            in a waterfall plan. You will remove features because of reasons you would never have considered in a
            waterfall plan. You need to fix bugs and adapt to changes. You need to be agile.</p>

        <p>However, always plan your next few features. Do that very carefully because too little planning and too
            much planning can both hurt the quality of your code, and the quality of your code is not something you
            can risk.</p>

        <h2>3) Underestimating the Importance of Code Quality</h2>
        <p>If you can only focus on one aspect of the code that you write, it should be its <strong>
                readability</strong>. Unclear code is
            trash. It is not even recyclable.</p>
        <p>Never underestimate the importance of code quality. Look at coding as a way to communicate
            implementations. Your main job as a coder is to clearly communicate the implementations of any solutions
            that you are working on.</p>
        <p>One of my favorite quotes about programming is:</p>
        <blockquote>
            <p class="highlight">
                Always code as if the guy who ends up maintaining your code will be a violent psychopath who knows where
                you live.</p>
            <p class="big"> — John Woods
